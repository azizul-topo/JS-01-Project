# Daily Mood Tracker

## Introduction

This **Daily Mood Tracker** is a web-based application designed to allow users to log their moods daily using an easy-to-use calendar interface. The app provides a simple and intuitive way to track daily emotional well-being and gain insights into mood trends over time. It stores data locally on the user's browser, allowing the moods to persist even if the page is refreshed.

The application features:
- **Emoji-based mood logging** (Happy, Sad, Neutral, Excited, Angry).
- A **calendar layout** where each day is clickable to log moods.
- **Month navigation** to track moods for different months and years (2024-2025).
- **Local storage** to save mood entries without requiring a backend server.

## Features

- **Calendar View:** Displays a monthly view where each day of the month is shown in a grid format. Each date is clickable to log the mood for that day.
  
- **Mood Logging:** When a user clicks on a specific day, an input form appears with various mood options (Happy, Sad, Neutral, Excited, Angry) to select. The mood is logged as an emoji on the selected date.

- **Data Persistence:** Moods are stored in the browserâ€™s **localStorage**, ensuring data persists even if the page is reloaded or revisited.

- **Month Navigation:** The user can navigate between months and years (2024-2025), with proper alignment of days to weekdays.

- **No Backend:** Everything is stored locally on the user's browser using **localStorage**, which makes this app fast and lightweight.

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Mood:** Click on any day in the calendar. You will be prompted to select your mood for that day.
  
2. **Select Mood:** Choose from the mood options (Happy, Sad, Neutral, Excited, or Angry), and the emoji corresponding to your mood will be saved for that day.

3. **View Mood History:** Your selected moods will appear under each respective date. You can navigate through months using the "Prev" and "Next" buttons.

4. **Data Persistence:** Once a mood is logged, it will remain saved and visible across page refreshes until manually cleared from **localStorage**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout adjustments for a responsive and clean UI.
- **JavaScript:** Handling of logic for mood tracking, calendar generation, and localStorage.
